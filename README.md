## A POTI-board that can use HTML5 versions of PaintBBS NEO , ChickenPaint , and klecks.

![PaintBBS NEO](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44894014/130362908-27922b42-6a4c-4c73-8ab6-a1f678014eed.png)

## Required php version

Required PHP version.PHP7.2 to PHP8.2

### To change the color scheme of the Default theme MONO
MONO's HTML and CSS have been significantly updated in v3.07.5.  
Therefore, if you use a CSS file older than v3.07.5, some designs will not be displayed correctly.  
For example, footers and catalogs don't look as intended.  
If you want to change only the color scheme, please use the SCSS for development.  

[css/dev/sass](https://github.com/satopian/poti-kaini-EN/tree/main/potiboard5/templates/mono_en/css/dev/sass)

It's easy to change the color scheme because the settings are separated for the color scheme and other designs.  
However, an environment that can handle SCSS is required.  
For example, the free [Visual Studio Code](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-code/) and its extension, [DartJS Sass Compiler and Sass Watcher](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=codelios.dartsass).

- Updated BladeOne to v4.5.5.
- Updated jQuery to v3.6.0.
Since the existence of the file is checked, the program will not run if the included jQuery does not exist.
The  case an error message telling you that the file does not exist.

### Improvements
- Fixed clickjacking vulnerability.
It will not be possible to display in frames or iframes.
It's more secure, but I know some people want to display it in a frame.
Therefore, we added a new setting item to config.php so that you can select whether or not to display it in the frame.
If you do not need to display in the frame, you do not need to add setting items.
```
// Deny display in iframe:  (1: Deny, 0: Allow)
// We strongly recommend "Deny" to avoid security risks.
define('X_FRAME_OPTIONS_DENY', '1');

```
I think it is difficult to rewrite config.php from scratch, so if you add the above setting items anywhere, you will be able to display it in the frame.

Optimized tap target size and spacing.

- Translated Klecks into Japanese.
I was able to bundle a Japanese version with POTI-board.
This new version of Klecks will automatically detect your browser's language priority and switch languages ​​for you.
You can also specify the language to use regardless of the browser language setting.
You can select English, German, or Japanese.
Chinese is only in Simplified Chinese and details are still in English.
Japanese translation resources have already been merged into the klecks repository.

### The download button for the application-specific file has been created.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44894014/160227733-b57a5783-d95a-4648-b484-5e065b2b7402.png)

#### App-specific format list
- `. Pch` file (PaintBBS)
- `. Chi` file (ChickenPaint)
- `. Psd` file (Klecks)

The file containing the layer information for Klecks is a `.psd` file in Photoshop format.
The downloaded `.psd` file can be opened by CSP, SAI and many other apps.
`.pch` and` .chi` can be opened with NEO and ChickenPaint, respectively.
If you attach `.pch`,` .chi`, `.psd` from the administrator posting screen and press the paint button, you can load it on the canvas and post it.

#### Transparent PNG, change the transparent part of the thumbnail of transparent GIF to white

- Fixed the problem that the transparent part of transparent PNG was black when it was converted to JPEG.
It is not a mistake that the transparent color is black, but since it often results in unintended results, when converting from transparent GIF or transparent PNG to JPEG, the transparent color is converted to white.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed the case where a minor error occurred when operating the upload format specific to the paint application used when logging in to the administrator, and the automatic deletion function of unnecessary temporary files such as pch, chi, and psd.
### BladeOne update

### Updated Klecks

A new brush has been added. You can now do mirror painting.

## [2022/03/8] v5.10.0

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44894014/157234120-d806d24f-2f2b-4600-9d29-515a5743efd6.png)

### fix

## [2022/02/10] v5.05.0

### URL blacklists
When the character string specified by the "String blacklists" exists in the URL, it is now rejected.
In addition, we have added a "URL blacklists" .

```
// URL blacklists
$badurl = array("example.com","www.example.com");

```

Previously, no spam word checking was done on the URL.

### Older threads don't show links to draw more. Do not allow the continuation to be drawn.

There was a function to lock the editing of articles that exceeded the specified number of days, but I was able to draw the continuation.
I created these settings because the article will be modified if the password is compromised by a third party.
Even if the article is locked, it can be deleted by the user.
In addition, the administrator can edit even after the specified number of days.

However, I think that some people may be in trouble if the lock is applied within a certain number of days.

`define ('ELAPSED_DAYS', '365');`

Threads older than 1 year will be locked in `365`,

`define ('ELAPSED_DAYS', '0');`
  
If set to `0`, it will not be locked.

- If the specified number of days has passed while drawing, it will be a new post.
Also, when the thread is deleted while drawing, it will be a new post.

## [2022/01/27] v5.01.03
### Change to BladeOne for template engine

I changed the template engine to BladeOne because I get a deprecated error from Skinny.php in PHP8.1 environment.
However, that means that the templates will be incompatible.
Templates with the extension `HTML` have been replaced with templates with the extension `blade.php`.
When you open the content, it's not much different from a traditional template. However, it may seem difficult because the extension is not HTML. 

### What has changed due to the change of the template engine
#### PHP7.4
- I was developing it to work in PHP5.6 environment, but I found that v4.2 of BladeOne only works in PHP7.4 or higher environment.
POTI-board EVO v5.x requires PHP 7.4 or higher.

#### Information for those who customize and use templates.
The thread display process has changed significantly.
Previously, there was processing for the parent of the thread, and there was separate processing for reply.

In v5.x, the loop of the array of one thread is ended at once.

It then treats the first loop as the parent of the thread.
Specifically, it looks like the following.

```
	@foreach ($ress as $res)
	 {{-- Parent article header -}}
	@if ($loop->first)
	{{-- First loop -}}
	<h2 class="article_title"><a href="{{$self}}?res={{$ress[0]['no']}}">[{{$ress[0]['no']}}]
			{{$ress[0]['sub']}}</a></h2>

	@else
	<hr>
	{{-- article header for reply -}}
	<div class="res_article_wrap">
		<div class="res_article_title">[{{$res['no']}}] {{$res['sub']}}</div>
		@endif

```

`@if ($loop->first)` is true for the first loop of the thread.
When `@if ($loop->first)` is true, it is processed as the parent of the thread.
The `<h2>` tag of the title that is displayed differently only when it is the parent of the thread is put in that place.

If you install the extension [laravel-blade](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cjhowe7.laravel-blade&ssr=false#review-details) in a free editor called VScode, the editor screen will appear. Switch to a color scheme optimized for the blade syntax.
Both the extension and the editor itself can be used free of charge.
### Files that have changed
all.
## Looking ahead for a few years
We apologize for the incompatibility of the template and the resetting of config.php, but we hope you understand it.

Also, please use the PHP script for the Oekaki bulletin board called [Petit Note](https://github.com/satopian/Petit_Note), which was newly recreated from scratch.


## [2021/12/22] v3.19.5

- Added the ability to display images of the next and previous threads in the reply view.  

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44894014/147068447-9fda9fbe-bfbe-473a-b318-72be33f54273.png)

  
- When you continue from the Reply image with a "new post", that image becomes the Reply image.  
Previously, if you continue and draw from the image of Reply, a new thread was created.  

- After replying, the screen of each thread that replied is now displayed.
Previously, the top page was displayed regardless of where you replied to the thread.
- Changed the display method when editing / deleting in reply mode or catalog mode and completing the work.
For example, when the edit / delete work is completed on the second page of the catalog mode, the second page of the catalog mode is displayed.
Until now, the top page was displayed.
- Individual threads are now displayed when you continue drawing and the post is complete.
Until now, the top page was displayed.
If the image you want to continue is many pages away from the top page, you had to find the image from many pages.

- ChickenPaint Swipe a specific part of the screen to prevent it from moving up or down. The relevant parts are controlled by JavaScript.  
  
## [2021/12/04] v3.15.3

- Updated index.php required for new installations.  
Even if the PHP version is PHP5.3 or lower, an error message will be displayed indicating that it will not work because the PHP version is low.  
Previously it was a fatal PHP error.  

- Fixed an issue where long press the ChickenPaint's palette with the pen would open an unwanted mouse right-click menu.

- Fixed an issue where the screen would move up and down when copying and layer merging with PaintBBS NEO.  
If you select a rectangle to perform a copy and layer combination operation, the pen may protrude slightly from the canvas.  
At this time, the PaintBBS NEO's canvas may move up and down.  
Occurs when using Windows ink or Apple Pencil.  
If a screen width wider than the iPad is detected, the screen will not move even if you swipe the mesh part around the canvas of PaintBBSNEO.  
When using a smartphone, the operation is the same as before. Because if you want to pinch out the canvas and zoom in,If you cannot swipe, you cannot operate.    

Please update `mono_paint.html` to resolve these issues.

- picpost.php
Fixed false positives for languages.

- Many translations have been improved.

## [2021/11/23] v3.15.2
### Updated contents of `potiboard.php`

- Chi file deletion process after upload painting  
I added it because there was no process to delete the chi file after uploading the ChickenPaint-specific file and the chi format file and loading it on the canvas in the administrator's post.  
This fix removes it from the temporary directory 5 minutes after uploading. Prior to this fix, files that were no longer needed were deleted after a few days.  
- The HTML ALT for images has been fixed. The HTML translation of the theme has been improved.  


## [2021/11/16] v3.12.2

### `potiboard.php` updates

- Fixed the calculation method of the width and height of the thumbnail image and the width and height of the HTML image when drawing the continuation.
The setting value of connfig.php is set as the maximum value and the calculation is restarted from the beginning.
In ChickenPaint, you can change the height and width of the image by rotating it, but until now, the size of the thumbnail image became smaller each time it was rotated.
- The actual canvas size is now set in the cookie. Previously, the value entered by the user was set as is. Since there is a maximum value for the canvas size, for example, when the maximum is 800px, even if you enter 8000px, the actual canvas size that opens is 800px.
Previously, the cookie was set to 8000px even in such cases.
- An error is now returned when a file name with an invalid length is entered.
- Checks the length of the reply number and returns an error if the length is incorrect.
- Fixed the specification that the full text of the parent's comment is displayed in the description of the article displayed on the reply screen, and now omits 300 bytes or more.

Please update `potiboard.php` by overwriting.

### [2021/10/27] v3.09.5

- To prevent the use of weak passwords, an error message will be displayed when the password is 5 characters or less. The error message is "Password is too short. At least 6 characters."
- In order to prevent tampering with articles by third parties, the function to lock replies to threads older than the set number of days has been expanded to lock editing of old articles.
You can delete it. In addition, the administrator can edit and delete as before.

- If you used the old config.php that doesn't have the following settings, you had to check or uncheck [no_imane].  
>// Use to the checkbox of [no_imane], do:'1', do not:'0'  
define('USE_CHECK_NO_FILE', '0');  

we changed this default value from "do:'1'" to "do not:'0'".  
Previously, even if you were using a new theme HTML file, you had to check or uncheck "[no_imane]" when the version of config.php was old.  
- Changing the copyright link on the site. [https://paintbbs.sakura.ne.jp/poti/](https://paintbbs.sakura.ne.jp/poti/)
